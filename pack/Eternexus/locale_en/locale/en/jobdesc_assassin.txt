Ninjas are professional[ENTER]
killers, who can attack[ENTER]
through ambush. In order to[ENTER]
maximise on both strength[ENTER]
and mobility, these[ENTER]
[WAIT]
assassins wear only light[ENTER]
armour. This allows them to[ENTER]
execute rapid and fluid[ENTER]
manoeuvres without[ENTER]
hindrance. Depending on[ENTER]
[WAIT]
their area of[ENTER]
specialization, Ninjas can[ENTER]
be master fighters in[ENTER]
close-combat situations with[ENTER]
daggers, or in[ENTER]
[WAIT]
distant-combat situations[ENTER]
with bows.
